# Skills-2018
This is the singular file for the 2018 Skills Canada autonomous competition.

This competition involved picking up pipes and delivering them to designated piles - the problem spec is [here](http://www.skillsontario.com/index.php?p=download&file=739).

Our best score was 7 points (picked up 7 pipes, but didn't deliver them).
